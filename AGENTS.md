# Repository agent instructions

These instructions apply to the entire repository and to every agent or sub-agent working in
it. More specific `AGENTS.md` files may add local guidance, but they must not weaken the data
correctness rules below.

## Mission and current state

This project predicts a full Fantasy Premier League (FPL) points distribution per player and
gameweek. It is a Python 3.12 data and modelling codebase built around DuckDB, Polars, Pydantic,
HTTPX, YAML configuration, pytest, Ruff, and strict mypy.

Phase 0b's historical and live data foundation is implemented and tested. Phase 1 modelling
has not started, but its evaluation contract is implemented in `config/phase1_evaluation.yaml`.
The official 2026/27 payload confirms 17 scoring fields; captured official rule sources confirm
the seven thresholds/units absent from it. Two replay edge cases remain explicitly unexercised.
Do not describe the ruleset as fully validated while either remains under
`verification.unverified`.

Full archive rebuilds are failure-atomic: `build_db` rebuilds a sibling DuckDB, preserves
existing live snapshot state, refuses to overwrite a concurrently changed target, and promotes
with one atomic replacement only after success.

`README.md` is the best current overview. Treat `docs/phase0-design.md` as a mixed historical
design/as-built audit: its opening status and pre-implementation decisions are stale. The
publish boundary is a design contract and is not implemented.

## Non-negotiable correctness rules

Preserve the R1-R6 rules in `README.md` and their tests.

- Never use recorded `total_points` as a model feature or cross-season model target. Model
  components/events and apply the target season's scoring rules.
- Scoring constants belong in `config/scoring_<ruleset>.yaml`, not Python. A rules change
  requires config validation and replay tests.
- Model distributions, not only expected values.
- All modelling features must be point-in-time correct. Use timezone-aware UTC instants and
  the `FeatureSource`/`PointInTimeView` capability; observed results use `kickoff_time < as_of`.
- Code under `src/fpl/features/` must not import DuckDB, issue SQL, accept a raw database
  connection, read `mart_target_*`, or expose future outcome columns through schedule data.
- Preserve daily live data because it cannot be reconstructed after season rollover.
- Keep the minutes model separate from per-minute event/rate models.

Also preserve these data contracts:

- Player identity is stable `code`; `element` is season-scoped. Team IDs are season-scoped.
- Never filter or join a bare team ID across multiple seasons. Require a season-qualified
  `(season, team_id)` key or another verified stable team identity.
- Player-fixture grain is `(season, code, fixture)`, not player-gameweek. Double gameweeks are
  real; exact duplicate source rows are not.
- `NULL` means unmeasured or unavailable and must not be silently converted to zero.
- Assistant Manager elements (`element_type == 5`) are not players and stay excluded.
- Raw archive tables remain all-VARCHAR. Interpret and repair values only at the staging
  boundary, with declarative repairs in `config/data_quality.yaml`.
- Snapshots, database rebuilds, and publish exports that claim all-or-nothing behavior must
  actually use a transaction or an atomic temp-output replacement. Add a failure-path test.
- Event time and knowledge time are different. `kickoff_time` prevents use of future match
  outcomes, but schedules, postponements, availability, and API fields must also be versioned
  by `known_at`/`captured_at` before they are safe for walk-forward backtests.

## Repository map and boundaries

- `config/`: sources, scoring rules, and declarative data-quality policy.
- `src/fpl/ingest/`: external archive/API boundaries and raw payload handling.
- `src/fpl/storage/`: DuckDB connection policy and schema.
- `src/fpl/transform/`: raw-to-staging crosswalks, validation, facts, and targets.
- `src/fpl/features/`: point-in-time-safe read API and, later, feature construction.
- `src/fpl/models/`: scoring now; statistical models belong here as phases advance.
- `src/fpl/jobs/`: thin orchestration/CLI entry points.
- `tests/`: executable data contracts; vendored API fixtures keep tests offline.
- `docs/`: design records and the future static publish contract.

Keep network clients, transformation logic, feature access, statistical models, orchestration,
and presentation contracts separated. Jobs should coordinate domain functions rather than
accumulating business logic. Nothing downstream of the future `publish` boundary may query
DuckDB.

## Working protocol

1. Read `README.md`, the relevant config, implementation, and tests before changing a
   contract. Inspect `git status --short` and preserve unrelated or user-owned changes.
2. State assumptions when FPL rules or upstream payload shape have not been verified. Never
   promote synthetic fixtures or inferred rules to confirmed facts.
3. Prefer an explicit typed contract at external boundaries. New network behavior needs
   retries, bounded timeouts, shape validation, and offline tests.
4. For schema or pipeline changes, test grain, row accounting, null semantics, season-scoped
   joins, idempotence, failure atomicity, schema drift, and point-in-time behavior.
5. For model work, define the walk-forward split and baselines before fitting. Iterate observed
   gameweeks rather than assuming `1..38`; 2022-23 has no GW7. Report calibration and
   distribution metrics in addition to ranking/point metrics.
6. Update code, tests, configuration, and the relevant documentation in the same change when
   a contract or roadmap status changes.
7. Keep tests deterministic and network-free. Use the local stub and clearly-labelled vendored
   fixtures. Archive-backed tests may be marked `archive`.

Run the smallest relevant tests while iterating, then use the full local gate before handoff:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\pytest.exe -q
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe check src tests
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe format --check .
.\.venv\Scripts\mypy.exe src
```

Equivalent `uv run` commands are acceptable. Do not add a new dependency casually; justify it
against the small single-file data scale, update `pyproject.toml` and the lockfile together,
and keep production dependencies separate from development tools.

## Priorities for upcoming work

Unless the user sets another priority, address prerequisites before model sophistication:

1. Reconcile the remaining stale Phase 0 design notes and publish-contract contradictions.
2. Implement the Stage A validation harness exactly against `config/phase1_evaluation.yaml`.
3. Fit the team model only after its entry gates pass; do not weaken promotion thresholds after
   observing candidate results.
4. Keep archive and live rebuild/capture failure-path tests aligned as schema roles evolve.

## Sub-agent coordination and handoff

- Give each sub-agent a bounded, non-overlapping scope and name the files it may edit.
- A review-only sub-agent must not edit files. An implementation sub-agent must not commit,
  discard, or rewrite another agent's changes.
- Shared schema/config changes need one owner; other agents should report proposed impacts
  instead of editing the same files concurrently.
- Report findings in severity order with file and line evidence. Distinguish confirmed defects,
  design gaps, and optional improvements.
- Handoffs must list changed files, checks run and their results, unresolved assumptions, and
  any data or network-dependent validation that was not possible.

## Skill routing

Use the smallest relevant skill when it materially helps. Repository-specific skills are:

- `$guard-fpl-point-in-time` at `.claude/skills/guard-fpl-point-in-time/SKILL.md` for feature and
  backtest leakage.
- `$verify-fpl-scoring-rules` at `.claude/skills/verify-fpl-scoring-rules/SKILL.md` for scoring config,
  payload verification, and replay coverage.
- `$validate-fpl-walk-forward` at `.claude/skills/validate-fpl-walk-forward/SKILL.md` for Phase 1+
  model evaluation and promotion gates.
- `$audit-fpl-live-snapshots` at `.claude/skills/audit-fpl-live-snapshots/SKILL.md` for live capture,
  rollover, freshness, atomicity, and snapshot ingestion.

Installed general-purpose skills that complement them are:

- `data-analytics:analyze-data-quality` for source drift, null semantics, anomaly policy, grain,
  completeness, and crosswalk work.
- `data-analytics:validate-data` before promoting a ruleset, data pipeline, or model result as
  ready to share or use.
- `data-analytics:jupyter-notebooks` for reproducible model experiments or exploratory SQL/Python
  that should become an auditable notebook.
- `data-analytics:design-kpis` for phase gates, model success criteria, operational freshness,
  and dashboard KPIs.
- `data-analytics:metric-diagnostics` for explaining changes in model or data-quality metrics.
- `data-analytics:visualize-data` for calibration, reliability, distribution, and backtest
  figures.
- `data-analytics:build-report` for a durable model-validation or season-review report.
- `data-analytics:build-dashboard` only when implementing or materially revising the dashboard.
- `github:gh-fix-ci` when diagnosing or repairing failing GitHub Actions checks after CI exists.

Skills do not override the repository invariants, offline-test policy, or explicit user scope.
