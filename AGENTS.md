# Repository agent instructions

These instructions apply to the entire repository and to every agent or sub-agent working in
it. More specific `AGENTS.md` files may add local guidance, but they must not weaken the data
correctness rules below.

## Mission and current state

This project predicts a full Fantasy Premier League (FPL) points distribution per player and
gameweek. It is a Python 3.12 data and modelling codebase built around DuckDB, Polars, Pydantic,
HTTPX, YAML configuration, pytest, Ruff, and strict mypy.

Phase 0b's historical and live data foundation is implemented and tested. Phase 1 modelling
has not started, but its evaluation contract is implemented in `config/phase1_evaluation.yaml`.
The official 2026/27 payload confirms 17 scoring fields; captured official rule sources confirm
the seven thresholds/units absent from it. Two replay edge cases remain explicitly unexercised.
Do not describe the ruleset as fully validated while either remains under
`verification.unverified`.

`README.md` is the best current overview. Treat `docs/phase0-design.md` as a mixed historical
design/as-built audit: its opening status and pre-implementation decisions are stale. The
publish boundary is a design contract and is not implemented.

## Non-negotiable correctness rules

Preserve the R1-R6 rules in `README.md` and their tests.

- Never use recorded `total_points` as a model feature or cross-season model target. Model
  components/events and apply the target season's scoring rules.
- Scoring constants belong in `config/scoring_<ruleset>.yaml`, not Python. A rules change
  requires config validation and replay tests.
- Model distributions, not only expected values.
- All modelling features must be point-in-time correct. Use timezone-aware UTC instants and
  the `FeatureSource`/`PointInTimeView` capability; observed results use `kickoff_time < as_of`.
- Code under `src/fpl/features/` must not import DuckDB, issue SQL, accept a raw database
  connection, read `mart_target_*`, or expose future outcome columns through schedule data.
- Preserve daily live data because it cannot be reconstructed after season rollover.
- Keep the minutes model separate from per-minute event/rate models.

Also preserve these data contracts:

- Player identity is stable `code`; `element` is season-scoped. Team IDs are season-scoped.
- Never filter or join a bare team ID across multiple seasons. Require a season-qualified
  `(season, team_id)` key, or `mart_dim_team.team_code` for cross-season club identity.
  `team_code` is 1:1 with the club (27 codes, 27 names over five seasons) and is the only
  key permitted for following a club between seasons, which Dixon-Coles time decay and
  promoted-team priors both require. The failure mode is not merely that ids move but that
  they return: id 10 is Leeds, Leicester, Fulham, Ipswich, then Fulham again, so a
  cross-season join on team_id appears to work and yields a Fulham history with Ipswich in
  the middle of it.
- A player can turn out for more than one club inside a season, so "which team is this
  player on" is a question with a time in it. `mart_dim_player.team_id` records only the
  club a player finished the season at: measured 242 transfer stints, of which the
  dimension matches 120. Resolve a player's club from the fact row's `team_id` or from
  `mart_dim_player_stint`, never from `mart_dim_player`. Do not assume two stints -- three
  clubs in one season occurs.
- When a player moves, his attacking *share* travels with him and the team *scale* does
  not. Defensive contribution is a property of the team system rather than the player
  (measured team hit rates range from 0.333 to 0.146), so a transferred player's DC
  expectation must be rescaled to the destination club, never carried over.
- Player-fixture grain is `(season, code, fixture)`, not player-gameweek. Double gameweeks are
  real; exact duplicate source rows are not.
- `NULL` means unmeasured or unavailable and must not be silently converted to zero.
- Assistant Manager elements (`element_type == 5`) are not players and stay excluded.
- Raw archive tables remain all-VARCHAR. Interpret and repair values only at the staging
  boundary, with declarative repairs in `config/data_quality.yaml`.
- Snapshots, database rebuilds, and publish exports that claim all-or-nothing behavior must
  actually use a transaction or an atomic temp-output replacement. Add a failure-path test.
- Event time and knowledge time are different. `kickoff_time` prevents use of future match
  outcomes, but schedules, postponements, availability, and API fields must also be versioned
  by `known_at`/`captured_at` before they are safe for walk-forward backtests.

## Repository map and boundaries

- `config/`: sources, scoring rules, and declarative data-quality policy.
- `src/fpl/ingest/`: external archive/API boundaries and raw payload handling.
- `src/fpl/storage/`: DuckDB connection policy and schema.
- `src/fpl/transform/`: raw-to-staging crosswalks, validation, facts, and targets.
- `src/fpl/features/`: point-in-time-safe read API and, later, feature construction.
- `src/fpl/validate/`: walk-forward folds, proper scoring rules, Stage A baselines, harness.
  It reads outcomes, which the feature layer may not -- scoring a prediction needs the label.
- `src/fpl/models/`: scoring now; statistical models belong here as phases advance.
- `src/fpl/jobs/`: thin orchestration/CLI entry points.
- `tests/`: executable data contracts; vendored API fixtures keep tests offline.
- `docs/`: design records and the future static publish contract.

Keep network clients, transformation logic, feature access, statistical models, orchestration,
and presentation contracts separated. Jobs should coordinate domain functions rather than
accumulating business logic. Nothing downstream of the future `publish` boundary may query
DuckDB.

## Working protocol

1. Read `README.md`, the relevant config, implementation, and tests before changing a
   contract. Inspect `git status --short` and preserve unrelated or user-owned changes.
2. State assumptions when FPL rules or upstream payload shape have not been verified. Never
   promote synthetic fixtures or inferred rules to confirmed facts.
3. Prefer an explicit typed contract at external boundaries. New network behavior needs
   retries, bounded timeouts, shape validation, and offline tests.
4. For schema or pipeline changes, test grain, row accounting, null semantics, season-scoped
   joins, idempotence, failure atomicity, schema drift, and point-in-time behavior.
5. For model work, define the walk-forward split and baselines before fitting. Iterate observed
   gameweeks rather than assuming `1..38`; 2022-23 has no GW7. Report calibration and
   distribution metrics in addition to ranking/point metrics.
6. Update code, tests, configuration, and the relevant documentation in the same change when
   a contract or roadmap status changes.
7. Keep tests deterministic and network-free. Use the local stub and clearly-labelled vendored
   fixtures. Archive-backed tests may be marked `archive`.

Run the smallest relevant tests while iterating, then use the full local gate before handoff:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\pytest.exe -q
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe check src tests
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe format --check .
.\.venv\Scripts\mypy.exe src
```

Equivalent `uv run` commands are acceptable. Do not add a new dependency casually; justify it
against the small single-file data scale, update `pyproject.toml` and the lockfile together,
and keep production dependencies separate from development tools.

## Measured constants

These were measured against the archive in this repository and supersede any external
figure. `docs/research-adaptation.md` carries the evidence and the contradicting sources.

- Home advantage is **pooled with decay, never taken from the last one or two seasons**.
  Per-season gaps are 0.208 / 0.416 / 0.321 / 0.092 / 0.303 goals; a single season's
  estimate has a standard error near 0.09, the same size as the "collapse" some sources
  report, and 2025-26 rebounded after 2024-25's low. Pooled value 0.268.
- Promoted-team prior: attack **0.719x** league (sd 0.157), defence **1.309x** (sd 0.228),
  as the mean of per-team ratios rather than a ratio of pooled means. The spread is the
  point -- Fulham 2022-23 arrived at 1.015 and Southampton 2024-25 at 0.466 -- so the prior
  must carry its variance and yield quickly to observed matches. Defence improves over a
  season (+31% conceded in GW1-10, +14% from GW11) while attack does not, so the two sides
  decay differently.
- Finishing (goals minus xG) does not persist: FWD 0.138, MID 0.060, DEF -0.103
  season-to-season. Shrink it essentially fully to the positional mean.
- Defender attacking signal is **xA, not xG**: persistence 0.784 against 0.319.
- Goalkeeper save rate is a league constant at **67.3% +/- 0.4pp** over five seasons, so
  individual deviation is almost all noise. `saves + goals_conceded` is the only available
  proxy for shots on target faced.
- Team strength combines **multiplicatively**: `atk x def_opponent` correlates 0.439 with
  goals scored, the subtractive form 0.070. Facing the weakest quartile of defences yields
  1.935 goals against 1.040 for the strongest -- a 1.86x range.
- Any persistence figure must be measured **within position**. Pooled across positions
  xG/90 reads 0.871, which measures the position rather than the player.
- **xG beats recorded goals as the Stage A training signal**, by +0.64% relative lift on mean
  log score, and wins in every season that has xG. The original specification's opposite
  finding predates the 2022-23 `expected_*` repair. 2021-22 has no xG at all, so the xG
  baseline degenerates to the league intercept there rather than competing.
- **80% interval coverage cannot be measured with a raw central interval on a count
  distribution.** Swept over rates 0.1-4.0, a perfectly specified Poisson covers 0.813 to
  0.983 and never lands on 0.80; across the 1.0-1.8 band where team goals sit it covers 0.92
  to 0.97. Use the randomised-PIT coverage, which lands on 0.798-0.803 for the same models.
  `ScoreReport.interval_80_absolute_error` already does; `config/phase1_evaluation.yaml`
  still gates on the raw figure and needs an owner decision before any candidate is judged.
- Polars `group_by` without `maintain_order=True` partitions across threads, so a float sum
  is not bit-reproducible: 16 of 20 repeat aggregations on this archive disagreed, and the
  difference reached the reported log score. Every aggregation feeding a pre-registered
  evaluation must pin the order.

## Priorities for upcoming work

Unless the user sets another priority, address prerequisites before model sophistication:

1. Make full archive database rebuilds failure-atomic; live capture is already transactional.
2. Reconcile the remaining stale Phase 0 design notes and publish-contract contradictions.
3. Resolve the `interval_80_maximum_absolute_error` gate. It is written against a quantity no
   count model can attain; the harness reports both coverages so the decision is informed.
   Amending a pre-registered gate is the user's call and must happen before a candidate is
   judged, not after.
4. Fit the team model only after its entry gates pass; do not weaken promotion thresholds after
   observing candidate results. The bar is `trailing_xg_attack_defence` at mean log score
   1.5227 over 181 folds and 3,640 predictions; a candidate needs 1.5075 or better to clear
   the 1% lift gate.

## Sub-agent coordination and handoff

- Give each sub-agent a bounded, non-overlapping scope and name the files it may edit.
- A review-only sub-agent must not edit files. An implementation sub-agent must not commit,
  discard, or rewrite another agent's changes.
- Shared schema/config changes need one owner; other agents should report proposed impacts
  instead of editing the same files concurrently.
- Report findings in severity order with file and line evidence. Distinguish confirmed defects,
  design gaps, and optional improvements.
- Handoffs must list changed files, checks run and their results, unresolved assumptions, and
  any data or network-dependent validation that was not possible.

## Skill routing

Use the smallest relevant skill when it materially helps. Repository-specific skills are:

- `$guard-fpl-point-in-time` at `.claude/skills/guard-fpl-point-in-time/SKILL.md` for feature and
  backtest leakage.
- `$verify-fpl-scoring-rules` at `.claude/skills/verify-fpl-scoring-rules/SKILL.md` for scoring config,
  payload verification, and replay coverage.
- `$validate-fpl-walk-forward` at `.claude/skills/validate-fpl-walk-forward/SKILL.md` for Phase 1+
  model evaluation and promotion gates.
- `$audit-fpl-live-snapshots` at `.claude/skills/audit-fpl-live-snapshots/SKILL.md` for live capture,
  rollover, freshness, atomicity, and snapshot ingestion.

Installed general-purpose skills that complement them are:

- `data-analytics:analyze-data-quality` for source drift, null semantics, anomaly policy, grain,
  completeness, and crosswalk work.
- `data-analytics:validate-data` before promoting a ruleset, data pipeline, or model result as
  ready to share or use.
- `data-analytics:jupyter-notebooks` for reproducible model experiments or exploratory SQL/Python
  that should become an auditable notebook.
- `data-analytics:design-kpis` for phase gates, model success criteria, operational freshness,
  and dashboard KPIs.
- `data-analytics:metric-diagnostics` for explaining changes in model or data-quality metrics.
- `data-analytics:visualize-data` for calibration, reliability, distribution, and backtest
  figures.
- `data-analytics:build-report` for a durable model-validation or season-review report.
- `data-analytics:build-dashboard` only when implementing or materially revising the dashboard.
- `github:gh-fix-ci` when diagnosing or repairing failing GitHub Actions checks after CI exists.

Skills do not override the repository invariants, offline-test policy, or explicit user scope.
